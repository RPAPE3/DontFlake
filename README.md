## Summary: 

### **Our application's mission:** We strive to make event planning and coordination much easier for all events from small-group hangouts to professional, full-scale events.
### **Date source:** Our data comes directly from all user's registered in the app's database

This app will dynamically render any of the user's friends events directly when logged in. \
It will also display any groups the user is in, as well as any of its own events.

## Web view: 
![Form]
![Feed]
![Profile]

## Future Development:
* Video recaps of events
* Group page components
* User-to-user chat in a group
* News data on local events

## Notes:
This app was built as a graduation project for the UA coding bootcamp. These seven developers are now certified, full-stack software developers working at various institutions around the United States.
